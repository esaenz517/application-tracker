## Introduction  

The **Job Application Tracker** is a tool designed to help users organize and manage their job application process. Instead of relying on boring spreadsheets or sticky notes, this application provides a structured way to keep track of every job application in one place.  

With the tracker, you can:  
- Add new job applications with relevant details  
- Edit or update applications as your job search progresses  
- Change the status of applications (e.g., *Applied*, *Interviewing*, *Ghosted*, *Rejected*)  

This project aims to simplify the job hunt for struggling computer science majors by giving you a clear overview of your progress and helping you stay on top of important deadlines and updates.
